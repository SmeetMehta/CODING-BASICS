Explainations for the programs:-

Reverse words in a given string:-

Note- For writing the program in Java, 1st I wrote the program using arraylist, it executed succesfully, but when i submitted it I got TLE. 
after facing that issue I used the Data struction stack for the 1st time in java.

1) First I run the for loop till the size of string and using the charAt function, I concatinate the character into an empty string, untill
   I encounter a "." 
2) I i come across the "." , I push the concatinated String (A word before the dot),I push a "." into the stack and then I initialze the string
   as null. (to store the next word in it).
3) After this just start concatinating the top of the stack into another string, using pop function and then return that string.
