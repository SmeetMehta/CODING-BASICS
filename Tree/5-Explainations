Explainations for the programs:-

Check for BST  :-

1) Given a the root node to the Tree, create a function which takes 2 arguments root and arraylist
    a) This method will store the inorder traversal in the array list given as the argument in the method.
    b) Using Reccursion the inorder travering is done and the values are stored in an ArryaList.
    
2) In the IsBST function make 2 array lists and store the inorder traversal in both of them.
3) After that use Collecetions.sort to sort any one of the List.
3) Make a Hashset and pass the list as the argument while declaring that.
    Note:- This is created to check weather the lements in the given tree are unique.
           If the elements are not unique, it cannot be a BST.
4) After that check if the 2 array list (Sorted and original) are same or not.
    Note:- Inorder traversal in a BST gives a sorted list.
5) If they are equal return true, else return false.
