Explainations for the programs:-

Middle Element:-

1) First I found the size of the linked list by trversing till the end. so that i can write the program 
   with the 2 possible test cases. 
2) If the size is even then i travesed while temp.next.next!=None:
    a) temp is assigned to next of next
    b) temp1 is assigned to next
    c) the data of temp1 of next is returned.
3) If the size is odd then i trversed while temp.next!=None:
    a) temp is assigned to next of next
    b) temp1 is assigned to next
    c) the data of temp1 is returned.
    
 
Reverse Linked List:-

1) I have used recursion to reverse the linked list.
