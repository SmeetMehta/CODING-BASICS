Parenthesis Checker

1) First convert the string into character array(for java) or List(for Python).
2) now for each character , if we encounter open paranthesis, then push the respective closing paranthesis into the stack
   usinf the if-else-if ladder. in the last else if check if the stack is empty or pop an element and if that element is not
   equal to the character we are encountering then return false.
3) out of the for loop return true if the stack is empty else return false.

Note:- for every opening paranthesis we push a closing paranthesis and if we encounter a closing paranthesis then it should be same as the top
       of the stack. if it is not then the paranthesis are not balances hence we return false in the last elseif.
