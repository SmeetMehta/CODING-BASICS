Explainations for the programs:-

Leaders:- 
1) declare an integer "max"  with the last value of Array and an empty list.
2) start the iteration of FOR loop from the end of the array.
3) put an if condition checking if the i'th element is greater than max. 
4) if true then add the element in the list and assign "max" as that element.
5) out of for loop reverse the list. and return the reversed list as ans.

Kadane's Algorithm:-
1) declare a variable "sum" as 0 and "maxsum" as maxint value.
2) start FOR loop from 0 to size of array and do the following.
3) add the i'th element in the sum
4) check if "maxsum" is less than "sum", if true then set "maxsum" as "sum".
5) Check if "sum" is less than 0, if true then set "sum" as 0.  (Very crucial step)
6) return maxsum.
