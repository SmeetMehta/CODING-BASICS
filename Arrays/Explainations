Explainations for the programs:-

Leaders:- 
1) declare an integer "max"  with the last value of Array and an empty list.
2) start the iteration of FOR loop from the end of the array.
3) put an if condition checking if the i'th element is greater than max. 
4) if true then add the element in the list and assign "max" as that element.
5) out of for loop reverse the list. and return the reversed list as ans.

Kadane's Algorithm:-
1) declare a variable "sum" as 0 and "maxsum" as maxint value.
2) start FOR loop from 0 to size of array and do the following.
3) add the i'th element in the sum
4) check if "maxsum" is less than "sum", if true then set "maxsum" as "sum".
5) Check if "sum" is less than 0, if true then set "sum" as 0.  (Very crucial step)
6) return maxsum.

Sum triplets:-
comments:- I first wrote the program using ArrayList and the find method in it but it the find method has time complexity of O(n)
which makes the tota complexity of the program as O(N^3). then i did some research and fount out that if we use HashMaps, keep the 
elements of the array as the key, and use the method "ContainsKey" then we could get the result with O(1) as the HashMaps uses the
BST to search the element.
